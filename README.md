# AR with the Stars!

Collabarators: **Sammy Truong** and **Justin Teh**

Our application attempts to distort reality with utilization of Apple's new Augmented Reality kit!
Users are able to take a snapshot/take a picture as if they were standing right next to their favorite celebrities!
(As a sample model, we have only implemented stars such as: Niki and Drake)

Time spend: **15** total hours spent in total

## Implemented Features

- [x] Exposed to the different applications of the SpriteKit within the ARKit
- [x] Learned how to add 2-Dimensional assets on to the augmented interface with different images or "celebrities"
- [x] Utilized ARKit SceneKit View 

## Future Implementations

- [ ] A snapshot button that would take a screenshot of what is displayed on the augmented view and can save the images to your your gallery
- [ ] A swipe feature (similar to that of when Snapchat users swipe through the different options of filters) that showcases the different celebreties
- [ ] Rather than a 2-dimensionl application to the celebrities in the app, the app can support a video/gif of the celebrities
